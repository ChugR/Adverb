Adverb - a project to distill Wireshark trace data into web pages
that show details of the AMQP protocol.

The data flow starts with a .pcapng file. This can be created by
Wireshark or some other network capture tool. This file captures
the binary AMQP traffic of interest.

Next the data is processed by tshark (terminal shark) to produce
a .pdml file, which is like .xml for protocol data.

Finally the pdml is processed by a script that emits javascript html
that a browser displays.

In its current form Adverb is set up to be a cgi-bin web service
and consists of a very few files:

  scripts/html/adverb.html   - The server web form
  scripts/cgi-bin/adverb.sh  - Bash script to process form data:
                                * use tshark to generate pdml
                                * run script to generate html
  scripts/adverb.py          - Python code to generate html from pdml
