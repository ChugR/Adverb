<h3>Form input fields</h3>
<ul>
<li>.pcapng file<br>This is the trace file to upload, process, and display.</li>
<li>Decode-as AMQP ports<br>Normally only port 5672 is decoded as AMQP.<br>
To decode more ports as AMQP enter a space-separated list of ports or port ranges, the <em>selectors</em>, as specified in 
<a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html">tshark -d option</a> <br>
Examples: "8888" "20000:10 10000-10019" "10000 10010 10020"</li>
<li>Search for AMQP traffic.<br>
Process captured frames not to/from port 5672 to look for possible AMQP traffic. 
Often traffic goes to brokers at random ports. Check this option to look for
AMQP frames. Checking this option may cause large numbers of traced frames to be
processed and produce a huge PDML intermediate file. This may take a long time.</li>
<li>Display intermediate PDML<br>
Show the wireshark .pdml intermediate file instead of the normal Adverb analysis display.<br>
Use this option for debugging.</li>
<li>Display transfer data sorted by content<br>
Facts about each transfer frame are recorded and sorted by message content. <br>
A CSV table is appended to the web page. Use this data to track the progress of a message
as it moves between messaging endpoints. The time of each message is measured in relative microseconds.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Wireshark can capture network traffic traces and decode the various protocol's details.
Development versions of Wireshark include Pavel Moravec's AMQP 1.0 decoder. However, for one reason or another Qpid developers and other users often can't use the version of Wireshark that has the AMQP decoder support that they need. <br><br>
This server aims to soften the Wireshark version requirement by making it easy for users of any version of Wireshark to see the decoded AMQP stream.
<br><br>
Additionally, this tool presents metadata about AMQP frames and makes correlations that are tedious to discover using only Wireshark
<h3>Use Case</h3>
<ul>
<li>Run any version of Wireshark capable of saving .pcapng files.</li>
<li>Capture the network traffic containing the AMQP of interest; save a .pcapng file</li>
<li>Using the submission form select .pcapng file and upload it.</li>
<li>Observe the decoded AMQP stream(s) in a web format.</li>
</ul>
Note that this tool set is not intended to replicate capture and filtering features that are built into Wireshark. Using this tool one may find flows and packets of interest in giant .pcapng files but use Wireshark to further filter the source into smaller .pcapng files.
<h3>Generating capture files</h3>
Install any recent version of wireshark and use the <strong>tshark</strong> 'terminal shark' to generate pcapng files. For instance:
<ul>
<li>Install wireshark.<br><b>sudo yum install wireshark</b></li>
<li>Generate a trace.<br><b>sudo tshark -F pcapng -i lo -w /tmp/your-file.pcapng</b><br>
Tips: 
<ul>
<li>Save files to /tmp. SELinux prevents saving files to /home.</li>
<li>The example uses interface 'lo'. You may use any supported interface.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Unprotect the file so that it may be uploaded.<br><b>sudo chmod 777 /tmp/your-file.pcapng</b></li>
</ul>
